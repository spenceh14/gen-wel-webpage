League Structure:
- 12 Team/$500 per team
o $6000 prize pool
 Payouts (VOTE)
 Champion
 Runner Up?
 Regular Season Champion?
 Toilet Bowl winner?
 Weekly Payouts?
o Ex) highest scoring loser
- 6 Team Playoff/Week 15 start, Week 17 championship
o One week per playoff match up.
- Losers Bracket (Toilet Bowl) (VOTE)

 Winner of the toilet bowl gets the first pick in the rookie draft. This really devalues
“tanking” for picks and makes the losers bracket exciting and valuable. Tie breaker
going to Head-to-Head &amp; second being total points for. (Again, the idea is to
promote winning and being competitive.)
 Payout for winning the loser’s bowl. If the winner gets the first pick, then this is
unnecessary. Should we go against the tournament for the first pick, then this
makes sense.
- Regular Season Record Option (VOTE)
o Standard
 Team record will be determined by individual match up Win/Loss
 Weekly outcome
 1-0/0-1
o Standard &amp; Aggregate
 Each week will provide 2 outcomes to every team.
 Match up outcome.
 League outcome
o Top 6 teams in scoring get a win.
o Bottom 6 teams in scoring get a loss.
o Weekly outcome
 2-0/1-1/0-2

 This negates matchup luck a bit (when the top two teams in weekly score match up)
and would really put the top 6 teams in the playoffs.
 Playoff outcomes would be in a head-to-head matchup format for both the
winners and losers bracket.

Drafts/Order Determination
- Start-up Draft
o Snake Draft
 Will be a slow draft tentatively scheduled to start Saturday, July 6 th at 8 am. (VOTE)
on date and time to start.
 Members will have 8 hours to make their pick. Draft will be frozen nightly 11p-8a.
With the time remaining balance rolling over accordingly.
 I had considered doing an auction draft, but honestly, I feel like that would take a
12-hour time slot on a weekend and would just be more of a headache than
anything else. So that will NOT be in consideration for this league.

o Draft Order (VOTE)
 App randomly selects the order of the draft.
 Pull names out of a hat.

 3 rd party contest. (EX: The top 12 PGA golfers are randomly assigned to members.
Their finish in the masters determines draft order. Should we do this, I will propose
4 events and the league will VOTE on what we want to do.)

o Should we do names out of a hat or contest. We will VOTE on if
the order is determined by the event and or if we want to do a
draft pick “draft” where the finishing order determines the order
in which members get to pick their pick in the start-up draft.

o Yearly Rookie Draft
 Draft Order (VOTE)
 Regular season standings/playoff finishes
 Toilet Bowl outcome/playoff finishes
 Will be in the same slow draft format as the start-up draft
 4 rounds
 4-person roster taxi squad (your teams minor leagues for those who are unfamiliar)
 Yearly date to be determined (VOTE)
 Should anyone leave the league, new owner will default to 1 st pick in the draft.
Multiple owners will be determined by previous years win/loss record. (VOTE)
 Used to incentivize a new owner to join the league.

Roster Settings
- Starting Line Up
o QB 1
o RB 2
o WR 2
o TE 1
o FLEX 2 (RB/WR/TE eligible)
o SUPERFLEX 1 (QB/RB/WR/TE eligible)
- Bench
o 12 spots (VOTE)
o Will determine how deep we want of rosters to be and how much value to be on the waiver
wire.
- Injured Reserve
o 2 spots
 Players must actively be on IR.
 Not eligible with suspensions/retirement/etc.

- Taxi Squad
o 4 spots
 Only rookies eligible
 Once added to active roster, they are not eligible to return to the taxi squad.
 Taxi squad locks the Wednesday prior to the first NFL game on Thursday night.
 Eligible to stay on taxi for one year, must be added to active roster or dropped
following the next years rookie draft.
- No defenses or kickers will be used in this league.
Scoring
- Passing
o 0.04 pts per yard passing
o 4 pts per passing TD
o 2 pts per passing 2 pt conversion
o -1 pt per interception
- Rushing
o 0.10 pt per yard rushing
o 6 pts per rushing TD
o 2 pts per rushing 2 pt conversion
- Receiving

o 1 pt per reception (RBs &amp; WRs)
o 1.5 pts per reception (TEs)
o 0.10 pts per yard receiving
o 6 pts per receiving TD
o 2 pts per receiving 2 pt conversion.
- Miscellaneous
o 6 pts per return TD (kickoff and punt)
o -2 per fumble lost.
o 6 pts per fumble recovery TD

Miscellaneous
- Asset protection (VOTE) (Common in large money fantasy football leagues)
o Trading next years picks
 EX) 2025 1 st round pick = No cost
o Trading 2 years out
 EX) 2026 1 st round pick = $250 deposit paid to the league at the time of trade
completion
 We can determine sliding scale for various rounds.
o Trading 3 years out
 EX) 2027 1 st round pick = $500 deposit paid to the league at the time of trade
completion
 We can determine sliding scale for various rounds.
o The idea behind this is to ensure league integrity. These deposits paid per trade will be
exactly that towards future years of the draft. Should people leave the league, these
deposits will be nonrefundable and used to cover the new managers dues into the league.
Essentially (X) number of years free based on the roster/assets they are inheriting.

- Trading Timeline/Outcomes
o All trades will be voted on by league members.
 6 votes to veto trades
 All voting will be publicly displayed on the trade to show what members
have voted for what outcome.
 48 hour holding period prior to trade finalization.
 Should the trade pass (7 approved votes) trade will process immediately.
No wait period will be required.
 Should a trade not reach the required number of votes to veto and the
voting window closes the trade is approved.
 As a member it is your responsibility to vote timely on all trades. You don’t
have to vote, but if you don’t you cannot dispute the outcome of the
trade.
- Startup costs (VOTE)
o Increased cost year one as insurance against teams leaving the league. Would just be rolling
deposits used in the event. ($41.00 additional per team in year 1 or 500/12)
o League Trophy
 If we want to have one or not, cost would be split

- Punishments/Outcomes (VOTE)
o Penalty for last place
 Can do something fun
 EX) has to run a lemonade stand outside of there house for 4 hours
 (Happy to vote on other examples)
 Last &amp; Second to last pay an additional $100 the following year
 A lot of big money leagues will do this to negate tanking and again add
insurance money to the pot should those owners leave the league in the
future.

 That money is then used to add to the pot for the following year or cover
start up costs who a new owner.

- League Board
o I am proposing additional committee members/positions for the league to diversify league
control. Positions proposed are:
 Commissioner: David Johnston
 Rule changes/General league management and processing/Dispute &amp;
Conflict Resolution
 Treasurer: (VOTE)
 Collects payments/allocates funds/processes payments.
 Quarterly reporting to the league (in season)
 I am happy to do both, but I don’t think it’s a bad idea to have a separation
of the financials from me as the commissioner.
 Anyone interested will have to nominate themselves to be considered for
the position. I will not include people who don’t want the position. Should
no one want it, I will assume the responsibility.

 Information: Spencer Haymond
 Website/League record keeping.

- League Calendar (VOTE)
o League Fees due date
o Rookie draft yearly date
 EX) Saturday following the NFL Draft
o League rollover
 EX) Monday following the Superbowl</p>
